# Primany Outcome ("PO") and Control Factor ("CF")
1. The exercise is analyzed in two main metrics: Primany Outcome ("PO") and Control Factor ("CF"), both can be quantitatively discribed by body segments, distances between anatomical landmarks, and relative angles.
- "PO"s are primary goals of the exercises, and quantitatively the body descriptors that change in order to reach the exercise goal. Typically the goal is achieved by maximization of a body parameter such as maximum knee flexion.
- "CF"s are physical constraints of the exercises which have to be maintained during the exercise. Typically the constraints are the fixation or alignment of a body segment to anatomical landmarks, such as correct trunk alignment along the sagittal plane.

# Questionnaire Sheet ("QS")
2. By answering a 10-question likert questionnaire sheet ("QS"), you will evalute the subjects' exercise accuracy with respect to the "CF"s and "PO"s while performing a repetition. 
- Question 1 to 3 investigated accuracy with respect to the "PO"s of the exercises.
- Question 4 to 10 measures how the postures of seven body segments, (head/neck, trunk, arms, pelvis and legs), are maintained during the exercise with respect to the "CF"s.

# Exercise Description ("ED")
3. A Exercise Description ("ED") will be provided that contains exercise name, description of the exercise in stages, "PO"s, and "CF"s.
- Exercise repetition(s) which better adhere to the "PO"s and "CF"s in the "ED" should be scored higher, while repetition(s) that deviate from these criteria scored lower.
- Each "PO" or "CF" entry starts with tags that corresponds to the related questions in "QS". These tags are enclosed by brackets in the ["n,n,..."] format. For example, a "CF" with a tag that says ["4,7"] means this CF is related to question 4 and 7 in the "QS".

# How to Answer the "QS"
4. You are to answer each question in the "QS" by providing your level of agreement or disagreement of the statement in the question based on the subject's exercise accuracy in the evaluation sequence. Please provide your answer in likert scale from 1 to 5 (1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, 5=Always) for each question. Answer the question using the below techniques:
- First, looking up the relevant "PO"(s) or "CF"(s) in the "ED" using the aforementioned tags. For example, when answering question 7 in the "QS", look up all "CF" entries in the "ED" that contains the tag ["7"].
- Evaluate the tagged "PO"s or "CF"s by counting the number of frames in the sequence where the maintainence of these "PO" or "CF" is achieved and use this as the answer. 
- A score of 5 should represent COMPLETE maintainence with the tagged "PO" or "CF" in the "ED" in all 5 frames in the sequence, while 1 means the subject maintained to the tagged "PO" or "CF" in 0 or 1 frame(s).
- Because the lack of compliance to the "CF" violates the premise of the exericse, an exercise with low "CF" score shall, acoordingly, have a lower "PO" score.
- Finally, be strict and impartial to the subject's performance.

# Additionals
- All subjects' faces has been blurred for privacy.
- Some subjects do not stand facing the camera directly, so counter for perspective shift when answering the questions.
- In cases where a body segment is not visible in the image due to image cropping or blurring, answer the question using reasoning and the posture of neighboring/connecting body segment. In the `reasoning` field in the response, write "the body segment is not visible".
- The subject holds a bar between their hands for exercise 1, 2, 3, and 5. Ignore the bar during the evaluation.
