# Exercise Name:
"Pelvis rotations on the transverse plane"

# Exercise Stages:
1. "The subject has to stand still with feet slightly apart."
2. "Without moving the feet, the subject makes a circular rotation with the pelvis in clockwise direction."
3. "Without moving the feet, the subject makes a circular rotation with the pelvis in counter clockwise direction."

# Exercise Requirements:
1. "During the exercise, the body must be kept well aligned, avoiding bending the trunk backwards or forwards. The feet must always be on the ground, slightly apart, with the knees slightly flexed."

# Parameter(s) to Maximize in the Exercise:
1. "Maximize the length of the spine base trajectories in the transverse plane (x , z). (In other words, Maximize circumference of the pelvis rotation.)"

# Parameter(s) to Maintain in the Exercise:
1. "Equal and Constant Extension angles of both elbows"
2. "Equal and Constant Extension angles of both knee"
4. "Equal Distance between the shoulders"
5. "Equal Distance between the left and right hip"
5. "Equal vertical sink distance of shoulders between left and right side of the body, when turned to the respective side"
