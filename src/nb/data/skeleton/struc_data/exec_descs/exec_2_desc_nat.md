# Exercise Name:
"Lateral tilt of the trunk with the arms in extension"

# Exercise Stages:
1. "The subject has to raise his/her arms above the head with the elbows completely extended and holding a bar with both hands (starting position)."
2. "The subject then has to tilt the trunk slowly first to the left and then to the right, keeping it exactly on the frontal plane."
3. "After each tilt, the subject returns to the starting position."

# Exercise Requirements:
1. "The movement must be performed so as to avoid bending the trunk backwards or forwards. The feet must always be on the ground, slightly apart, with the knees slightly flexed."
	
# Parameter(s) to Maximize in the Exercise:
