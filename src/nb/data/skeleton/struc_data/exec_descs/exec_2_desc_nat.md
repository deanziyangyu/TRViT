# Exercise Name:
"Lateral tilt of the trunk with the arms in extension"

# Exercise Stages:
1. The subject has to raise his/her arms above the head with the elbows completely extended and holding a bar with both hands (starting position).
2. The subject then has to tilt the trunk slowly first to the left and then to the right, keeping it exactly on the frontal plane.
3. After each tilt, the subject returns to the starting position.

# Parameters for POs:
1. Maximize the angle between the vertical axis in the frontal plane and the line formed between left hip & left shoulder.
2. Maximize the angle between the vertical axis in the frontal plane and the line formed between right hip & right shoulder.

# Constraints Factors (CFs):
1. The subject must avoid bending the trunk backwards or forwards.
2. The feet must always be on the ground, slightly apart.
3. The knees must be slightly flexed.

# Parameters for CFs:
1. Must have Equal and Constant Extension angles of both elbows.
2. Must have Equal and Constant Extension angles of both knees.
3. Must have Constant distance between hand tips to the spine.
4. Must have Constant distance between shoulders to the spine.
